# Snake Web Game

## Description
A game inspired by the classic game of snake. Use WASD, the arrows keys, or the on screen buttons to move the character around the board. Collect 15 yellow squares to advance to the next level. With each new level adds a new obstacle. Run into one of the red squares and it is game over.

## Purpose
This application was made with the intention of further understanding vanilla javascript, learning about the html canvas, and to understand basic game logic.
